<p>An object-oriented language with eager evaluation, first-class
functions, and dynamic types. It is based on a notion of objects as
mutable and extensible records. There are no classes.</p>

<p>An interesting feature of the language is that, since "everything is
an object", a value may behave simultaneously as an integer, boolean,
function, and a record. This is reminiscent of intersection types.</p>
