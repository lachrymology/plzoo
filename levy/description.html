An implementation of <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~pbl/">Paul
Levy's</a> <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~pbl/cbpv.html">call-by-push-value</a>
language, with recursion. This language is very precise about what
gets evaluated when. Call-by-value and call-by-name can be embedded in
it.

See the enclosed <code>README.txt</code> and <code>example.levy</code>
file for details about syntax.</p>
