A simple lazy purely functional language with parametric
polymorphism. The implementation contains a parser, type inference,
and an efficient interpreter. The language has integers, booleans,
lists, pairs, functions, and a general fixpoint operator.</p>

<p>Poly is very similar to MiniHaskell. The only difference is that it
infers polymorphic types.
